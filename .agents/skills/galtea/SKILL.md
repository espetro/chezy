# Galtea

Galtea is an AI product testing and evaluation platform. Teams use it to define behavioral specifications, generate datasets of test cases, run evaluations (AI-as-judge, deterministic, or human), and iterate their AI products toward production with confidence.

This skill drives the **`galtea` CLI** on behalf of the user: install the binary, authenticate, discover commands and docs, then run or inspect evaluations. The CLI ships one subcommand per OpenAPI operation under a `galtea <noun> <verb>` tree (e.g. `galtea products list`, `galtea evaluations create-from-version`), so the source of truth for arguments is `galtea <noun> <verb> --help`. This file points at it rather than duplicating endpoint shapes.

If the user is new to Galtea, send them through `https://docs.galtea.ai/quickstart`, then `https://docs.galtea.ai/sdk/tutorials/writing-specifications`, then `https://docs.galtea.ai/sdk/tutorials/run-dataset-based-evaluations` -- the shortest zero-to-evaluation path.

Any docs page URL works with a `.md` suffix (e.g. `https://docs.galtea.ai/quickstart.md`) to get clean markdown content.

## How Galtea Works

### Platform entities

The entities the agent will work with most, grouped by lifecycle scope:

- **The product under test:** `Product` -> `Version` -> `EndpointConnection` (how Galtea reaches the running product). `Specification`s define what the product should do; each links `Metric`s and auto-derives `Dataset`s.
- **What you test with:** `Dataset` groups `TestCase`s. A `Metric` defines how to score -- see "Metric types" below.
- **What the product produces at runtime:** `Session` -> `Trace` (one turn) -> `Span` (internal tool / LLM calls captured per turn).
- **How performance is measured:** an `Evaluation` applies a `Metric` to a whole `Session` (conversation-level) or to one `Trace` (turn-level). `create-from-version` is the high-level entry point that resolves all of the above for a `Version` in one call -- see "Evaluation creation paths" below.

**The REST paths and wire fields kept their pre-rename spelling.** The entities were renamed; the HTTP contract was not. So `Dataset` still lives at `/tests`, `Trace` at `/inferenceResults`, and `Span` at `/traces`, and body and query fields stay `testIds`, `inferenceResultId`, and so on. You see the new names in the CLI nouns and the SDK; you see the old ones in URLs, JSON payloads, and `--flag` names. Both are current -- do not "fix" either to match the other.

Supporting entities: `Model` (LLM the product runs on, linked to a `Version`) is distinct from the evaluator model named on AI-as-judge `Metric`s. `UserGroup` routes `HUMAN_EVALUATION` metrics to specific reviewers.

Read [Concepts Overview](https://docs.galtea.ai/concepts/overview) (append `.md` for clean markdown) for the canonical diagram, schema-validated relationships, and per-concept docs pages.

### Revisions and history

`Version`, `TestCase`, and `Metric` keep history. Nothing else does -- and **a `Dataset` itself
has no revisions**, only the `TestCase`s inside it, which is the answer users most often get
wrong. The three mechanisms differ: editing a `TestCase` forks a new revision and retires the old
row, a `Metric` revision is created rather than edited, and a `Version` parent link is provenance
only with nothing retired. No entity has a revision number, and no endpoint returns a family's
history. Before answering "can I version X?", read
[references/entity-revisions.md](references/entity-revisions.md).

### Two evaluation contexts

| Context | When to use | How it works |
|---|---|---|
| **Pre-deployment (dataset-based)** | Regression testing before release against curated or generated `TestCase`s | Create `Dataset` + `TestCase`s, run the agent against them, evaluate. Direct invocation for single-turn; the Conversation Simulator for multi-turn (default for Behavior datasets). |
| **Production monitoring** | Evaluate real user interactions after deployment | Log `Trace`s from production into a `Session` (single-turn or multi-turn), evaluate asynchronously. |

**Multi-turn applies to both contexts.** A `Session` can hold many `Trace`s regardless of origin. By default, only Behavior datasets are *generated* with multi-turn scenarios in mind (`goal`, `userPersona`, `stoppingCriterias`); Accuracy and Security datasets can technically be multi-turn but are typically single-turn.

### Dataset types: the name depends on the surface

`DatasetType` has a user-facing name and a wire value, and they differ. Pick by the surface you are on:

| Meaning | SDK (user-facing) | CLI / raw API (wire) |
|---|---|---|
| Quality and correctness | `ACCURACY` | `QUALITY` |
| Security, safety, and bias | `SECURITY` | `RED_TEAMING` |
| Multi-turn dialogue | `BEHAVIOR` | `SCENARIOS` |

The **SDK accepts either name** on `galtea.datasets.create(type=...)` and normalizes it (`DatasetType.ACCURACY` is the enum form). The **CLI and raw API accept only the wire value** -- `galtea datasets create type: SCENARIOS` works, `type: BEHAVIOR` does not. `galtea datasets list-types` reports wire values too (the distinct types already in use, not the full catalog). `TestType` is the old name for `DatasetType` and still imports, with a deprecation warning.

### Metric types (verify against docs)

The `MetricSource` enum drives this:

- **AI-as-judge** (`PARTIAL_PROMPT`): An LLM scores the output against a user-written judge rubric; Galtea prepends (or appends, per the metric's parameter-position flag) a structured data block built from the separately-supplied `evaluation_params`. User-creatable. Most common. **Use this for any new AI-as-judge metric.**
- **`FULL_PROMPT` (creation rejected by the API):** Legacy AI-as-judge variant where the user wrote the entire prompt, including the location of the data (`evaluation_params`). The API rejects `POST /metrics` calls with `source=FULL_PROMPT` -- both explicit and silently inferred (the latter happens when a judge prompt is supplied without `evaluation_params`). Existing FULL_PROMPT metrics still list, filter, and evaluate normally. Use `PARTIAL_PROMPT` for any new metric.
- **Human evaluation** (`HUMAN_EVALUATION`): A human reviewer scores via the platform. Requires `UserGroup`s. User-creatable.
- **Self-hosted / user-computed** (`SELF_HOSTED`): You compute the score on your own infrastructure and upload it as a `float` -- either pre-calculated, or computed at runtime via an SDK custom-score class (see `/concepts/metric/evaluation-types` and `/sdk/tutorials/evaluate-with-custom-metrics` for current SDK class names). User-creatable.
- **Built-in deterministic** (`DETERMINISTIC`, `DEEPEVAL`): Platform-defined classic NLP and DeepEval metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, JSON field match, etc.). Galtea computes the score. **Not user-creatable** -- pick from the catalog.

The enum also holds `GEVAL`, deprecated and not creatable.

Custom-vs-built-in is orthogonal: users can create custom metrics in any of the user-creatable types above. Fetch `/concepts/metric` and `/concepts/metric/evaluation-types` for the authoritative catalog.

## Core Rules

1. **Use the `galtea` CLI for everything that talks to the API.** If `galtea --version` does not return a version, install the binary first (see the CLI Installation section below and [references/cli-install.md](references/cli-install.md)). If `galtea whoami` is not authenticated, run the Authentication flow below before any other call. Never hand-craft `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ..."` requests when a `galtea` command exists -- the CLI handles auth, retries, output formatting, and follows server-side schema changes via `galtea sync`. The one exception is moving file bytes, which the CLI cannot do: for uploading or downloading a dataset CSV or an attached file, use the Python SDK (see "Upload a dataset the user already has").
2. **Documentation first -- never advise from memory.** Galtea ships frequently; commands, metrics, and SDK APIs change. Before you advise on a workflow, concept, or argument shape, fetch the relevant docs page (see "Discover docs and commands" below) and run `galtea <noun> <verb> --help` for the live argument shape. **Prefer the raw Markdown form of docs pages by appending `.md` to the route** (for example, `https://docs.galtea.ai/quickstart.md` or `https://docs.galtea.ai/cli/installation.md`) -- it is the fastest and most reliable way to read complete docs content without losing text to tabs or client-side rendering. Examples inlined here are illustrative, not authoritative.
3. **Discover commands via `galtea --help`.** `galtea --help` lists every resource (`products`, `evaluations`, `sessions`, ...); `galtea <noun> --help` lists verbs under a resource; `galtea <noun> <verb> --help` shows the example invocation, request schema, and response schema for one operation. After the API ships new endpoints, run `galtea sync` to refresh the local spec cache.
4. **Argument syntax depends on the HTTP verb.** GET / list operations expose query params as kebab-case `--flag` arguments (e.g. `galtea evaluations list --version-ids v1,v2 --statuses PENDING`). POST / create / update operations take body fields via Restish's inline shorthand (e.g. `galtea evaluations create-from-version versionId: ver_xxx`) or JSON on stdin (e.g. `echo '{"versionId":"v1"}' | galtea evaluations create-from-version`). **Separate two or more body fields with commas** (`name: "x", productId: <id>`); without them the parser swallows every later field into the first field's value and the write fails naming the wrong field, which does not read as a syntax error. An array goes through the shorthand only in the bracket form the `--help` examples use (`specificationIds: [spec_1, spec_2]`); a repeated field arrives as a string and the server answers `500`. A comma inside an unquoted value breaks the parse (`Expected colon but got }`, or a Go panic), so quote the value or pipe JSON; a nested body is legal as `foo.bar: 1` but clearer as JSON on stdin: pipe JSON on stdin for those. The `EXAMPLES` block in `--help` shows the right form for each operation. **In non-TTY contexts (scripts, CI, agent harnesses) always redirect stdin on the inline-shorthand form** -- append `</dev/null` (or pipe a JSON body in) -- otherwise the command blocks waiting for stdin even when the inline body is complete. See Gotchas.
5. **Evaluations are async, but the create response shape varies.** `galtea evaluations create-from-version` returns `202` with `{jobId, message, specifications, testCaseCount, versionId}` -- the rows have not been created yet, so list them with `galtea evaluations list --version-ids <id> --statuses PENDING` to learn their IDs. Three create paths (`create-from-session`, `create-from-trace`, `create-single-turn`) return `201` with the array of `Evaluation` rows already persisted -- pull IDs straight from that response, no listing step needed. `create-from-sessions` (plural) is a third shape: `200` with a batch summary (`evaluationsCreated`, `sessionsEvaluated`, `sessionsFailed`, `failures`, `truncated`), no rows and no `jobId`, so list by `--session-ids` afterwards. In every case the rows start at `status: PENDING`; **batch-poll** via `galtea evaluations list` (one HTTP request per poll cycle regardless of count) -- prefer a scoped filter (`--version-ids` / `--session-ids` / `--inference-result-ids`) when one is available, since scoped filters can be combined with `--statuses` safely. When you only have raw IDs (e.g. `create-single-turn`), use `--ids` alone and filter status client-side -- see the "`--ids` + any other filter" gotcha below. Only fall back to `galtea evaluations get <id>` when you have a single ID and need its full detail. Stop when no rows remain at `status: PENDING`. Terminal states are `SUCCESS`, `FAILED`, `SKIPPED`, `CANCELLED`, `OUTDATED` (a monitor evaluation whose session reopened), and `PENDING_HUMAN` (waits for a human reviewer -- treat as terminal for polling and surface to the user).
6. **Soft deletes.** Deleted rows have `deletedAt` set; list endpoints exclude them by default.
7. **Discover the user's org via `galtea auth get-current-user`.** The authenticated user belongs to exactly one org, exposed as `organizationId` on the returned `User`. For credit status: `galtea organizations get-credit-status <organizationId>` (positional id), which returns `remainingCredits`, `monthlyCredits`, `isLowCredits`, `isExhausted`.
8. **`list` endpoints default to your own org.** A bare `galtea <noun> list` (no filters) returns only the entities in *your* organization -- the API key implies the org, so you never pass an org id to see your own data. Narrow within your org via the relation filters shown in `--help` (`--product-ids`, `--version-ids`, …).

## Environment

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GALTEA_API_KEY` | `gsk_*` bearer token. When set, takes precedence over the cached key in `apis.json`. Useful for CI / scripts / Docker; once `galtea login` has run on a developer machine, this is optional. |
| `GALTEA_CONFIG_DIR` | Override the per-user config directory where `apis.json` (host + token) lives. Defaults: `~/.config/galtea` (Linux), `~/Library/Application Support/galtea` (macOS), `%AppData%\galtea` (Windows). |
| `GALTEA_CACHE_DIR` | Override the cache directory for the parsed OpenAPI spec (`raw.cbor`). Defaults to `~/.cache/galtea/`. |
| `NO_COLOR` | Set to any value to disable ANSI color in CLI output. |

Run `galtea help environment` for the canonical list as the binary sees it.

The changelog at `https://docs.galtea.ai/changelog` lists every new metric, endpoint, and feature by date -- consult it when the user asks about something recent.

## CLI Installation

If `galtea --version` does not return a version, install the CLI before doing anything else. The full Homebrew / apt / dnf / pip install paths and verification steps live in [references/cli-install.md](references/cli-install.md). Quickest path on any OS with Python 3.9+:

```bash
pip install galtea-cli
galtea --version
```

The PyPI wheel bundles the same `galtea` binary used by every other channel. For Homebrew, Debian/Ubuntu (`apt`), Fedora/RHEL/Rocky/Alma (`dnf`/`yum`), and the official repository setup, see [references/cli-install.md](references/cli-install.md). Do not run `sudo` install commands on the user's machine without their explicit approval -- surface the command and let them run it.

## Authentication

Galtea uses bearer-token auth. The CLI handles the `Authorization` header, retries, and key persistence -- you do not write `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ..."` yourself.

### First-time login

```bash
galtea login
# Paste your gsk_* API key when prompted.
# The CLI validates against the server, stores the key at the platform
# config dir (mode 0600), and refreshes the OpenAPI command tree in the same step.
```

If the user does not have a key, send them to `https://platform.galtea.ai/settings`. An account has one key by default; regenerating it permanently replaces it. Enterprise plans can hold several named tokens, managed with `galtea api-tokens list | create | rename | revoke | regenerate`. Keys are shown once -- they should store it somewhere safe before closing the page.

### Non-interactive (CI, Docker, scripted agents)

```bash
export GALTEA_API_KEY=gsk_...
galtea login          # optional once GALTEA_API_KEY is exported
```

When `GALTEA_API_KEY` is set, `galtea login` becomes optional -- API calls pick up the env var directly. Run `galtea login` once on a developer machine to also refresh the OpenAPI command tree; in a short-lived CI job that runs only one or two API calls, the env var alone is sufficient.

There is intentionally **no plaintext `--api-key` flag** -- a flag value lands in shell history (`~/.bash_history`, `~/.zsh_history`) and `ps` listings, so credentials passed that way leak. Use the env var or the interactive prompt.

**Receiving a pasted key from the user.** Take the key as sensitive free-text in the chat; do **not** use any structured-question tool (e.g. Claude Code's `AskUserQuestion`) for this -- pasting secrets into option metadata leaks them into logs. Either (a) ask the user to run `galtea login` themselves and paste at the CLI prompt, or (b) accept the key in chat and pass it once via `GALTEA_API_KEY=<key> galtea login` -- never echo it back, never write it to a tracked file.

### Self-hosted / staging

```bash
galtea login --host https://galtea.your-company.example.com
```

The host is persisted in `apis.json`; subsequent calls hit that host until you run `galtea login` again with a different `--host`.

### Verify

```bash
galtea whoami                  # host + key fingerprint + auth status (exits non-zero if not authenticated)
galtea auth get-current-user   # full User object, including organizationId
galtea health                  # pings the API; useful as a connectivity probe
```

### On 401 from a previously valid key

The key was rotated or revoked. Reset:

```bash
galtea logout
galtea login          # paste the new key
```

## Discover docs and commands

### Docs index (`llms.txt`)

Cache the index under `/tmp` with a 24-hour TTL so you do not re-download each turn:

```bash
if [ ! -f /tmp/galtea-llms.txt ] || \
   [ -n "$(find /tmp/galtea-llms.txt -mmin +1440 2>/dev/null)" ]; then
  curl -s https://docs.galtea.ai/llms.txt > /tmp/galtea-llms.txt
fi

grep '/sdk/tutorials/'  /tmp/galtea-llms.txt   # tutorials (end-to-end playbooks)
grep '/concepts/'       /tmp/galtea-llms.txt   # entity definitions + hierarchy
grep '/api-reference/'  /tmp/galtea-llms.txt   # per-endpoint reference pages
grep '/cli/'            /tmp/galtea-llms.txt   # CLI installation / usage

# Fetch one specific page as clean markdown (append .md to any page URL)
curl -s https://docs.galtea.ai/sdk/tutorials/run-dataset-based-evaluations.md
```

For end-to-end playbooks (creating a product, simulating conversations, tracing an agent, human evaluation, production monitoring) look under `/sdk/tutorials/`. For entity definitions and the hierarchy between them look under `/concepts/`. For per-endpoint reference pages look under `/api-reference/`. For CLI installation and usage, look under `/cli/`.

**Tool preference for doc fetching.** If your host agent provides `WebFetch` / `WebSearch` (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.), prefer them over `curl` -- they handle summarization, caching, and large-page trimming for free. Use `curl` when you need raw bytes for a `grep` pipeline, when caching to `/tmp`, or when no native fetch tool is available.

### CLI commands

```bash
galtea --help                     # all resources (products, evaluations, sessions, ...)
galtea <noun> --help              # all verbs under one resource
galtea <noun> <verb> --help       # description, request schema, response schema, examples
galtea sync                       # refresh the local OpenAPI command tree after an API release
galtea raw <verb>                 # escape hatch for the bare Restish form (hidden from --help, still works); takes the kebab verb, e.g. `galtea raw get-current-user`
```

The CLI re-parents every OpenAPI operation under a `<noun>` parent generated from the spec's `tags`, with the `x-cli-name` extension as the verb; the four tag-less routes (`health`, `minimum-sdk-version`, `build-info`, `build-info-services`) stay at the top level. The resource list always reflects the latest `galtea sync`.

### Output formats

```bash
galtea X Y                  # default is `auto`: human-readable on a TTY, JSON when piped -- pass -o json to be sure
galtea X Y -o table         # only valid against array/list responses; on an object or an error body the command fails with `error building table. Must be array of objects`
galtea X Y -o json | jq …   # pipe through jq for ad-hoc filtering
galtea X Y -f body.id       # restish result filter (single field, no jq needed)
```

For debugging an HTTP-level issue, `-v` or `--verbose` makes the CLI print the underlying request/response. **That output includes the full `Authorization: Bearer gsk_...` header.** Never run it as an agent and never run it in CI: the captured tool output or the build log is itself the leak, and a key that lands in one has to be rotated. Hand the command to the user instead, to run in their own terminal, and tell them to delete the `Authorization` line before they paste any of it into a reply, an issue, or a bug report. (Note: `-V` is bound to `--version`; both `-v` and `--verbose` enable HTTP debug output.)

## Evaluation creation paths

Choose the right creation command based on what the user wants to evaluate. For a complete end-to-end CLI walkthrough of the `create-from-version` path (find product -> find version -> create -> list PENDING -> poll), read [references/evaluate-version.md](references/evaluate-version.md) -- fetch it whenever the user asks to run a full evaluation pass on a version, kick off evaluations, or needs to see the async lifecycle concretely.

| User goal | Command | Key input | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Evaluate all datasets for a version at once | `galtea evaluations create-from-version` | `versionId: <id>` | Resolves specs, metrics, and datasets automatically |
| Evaluate a specific conversation | `galtea evaluations create-from-session` | `sessionId: <id>` | Optional `metrics`, `specificationIds` body fields to narrow scope |
| Evaluate a single turn (production monitoring) | `galtea evaluations create-from-trace` | `inferenceResultId: <id>` | Body field keeps the old name -- see the wire-contract note above. Optional `metrics`, `specificationIds` |
| Quick one-off evaluation without sessions | `galtea evaluations create-single-turn` | `actualOutput`, `metrics`, and a `versionId` or `productId` | With `productId` the platform reuses the product's latest version, creating one only if the product has none. `testCaseId` is required while `isProduction` is false; set `isProduction` true and `input` replaces it. The two are exclusive |
| Evaluate many existing sessions at once, no endpoint connection needed | `galtea evaluations create-from-sessions` | `sessionIds: [...]` or `versionId`, optional `metrics` / `specificationIds` | Imported traces; returns a `200` batch summary, then list by `--session-ids` |
| Re-run failed evaluations | `galtea evaluations retry` | `ids: [e1, e2, e3]` (body) | Eligibility is the evaluation's `canRetry` flag, not its status, so a credit-exhausted `SKIPPED` retries too. Non-retriable ids come back counted in `skipped` rather than as a 404; returns 202 with `{retried, skipped, errors}` |
| Replay onto a new metric revision | `galtea evaluations replay-from-metrics` | `metricGroupId`, `newMetricId`, `productIds` (body) | Returns 202 |
| Replay onto a new test case revision | `galtea evaluations replay-from-test-cases` | `testCaseGroupId`, `newTestCaseId`, `productIds` (body) | `newTestCaseId` must be the active head of its family. Fresh inference is generated per version before scoring, production sessions excluded; returns 202 |

The create paths split into three groups by response shape:

- **`create-from-sessions` -- synchronous batch, returns 200 + a summary** (`evaluationsCreated`, `sessionsEvaluated`, `sessionsFailed`, `failures`, `truncated` at 1000 sessions). No rows and no `jobId` come back; list them with `galtea evaluations list --session-ids <ids>`.
- **`create-from-version` -- async, returns 202 + `jobId`.** The actual evaluation rows are created in the background. List them with `galtea evaluations list --version-ids <id> --statuses PENDING` to learn their IDs (this is the path walked end-to-end in [references/evaluate-version.md](references/evaluate-version.md)).
- **`create-from-session`, `create-from-trace`, `create-single-turn` -- synchronous-creation, return 201 + array of `Evaluation` rows.** Pull IDs straight from the response; no separate listing step needed. Then **batch-poll** the whole set in one call:

  ```bash
  # Capture the array, build a comma-separated id list, then poll the batch.
  # `list --ids` returns the full Evaluation rows in one HTTP request,
  # avoiding the N-call overhead of looping `evaluations get` per id.
  # </dev/null on the create call is required in non-TTY contexts -- see Gotchas.
  IDS=$(galtea evaluations create-from-session sessionId: <sessionId> -o json </dev/null | jq -r '[.[].id] | join(",")')
  galtea evaluations list --ids "$IDS" -o json | jq '.[] | {id, status, score}'

  # Poll until none are PENDING. Filter status CLIENT-SIDE -- combining `--ids` with
  # `--statuses PENDING` triggers a false 404 once the rows leave PENDING (see Gotchas).
  while [ "$(galtea evaluations list --ids "$IDS" --no-cache -o json | jq '[.[] | select(.status == "PENDING")] | length')" -gt 0 ]; do
    sleep 5
  done
  galtea evaluations list --ids "$IDS" -o json | jq '.[] | {id, status, score}'
  ```

  Substitute `create-from-trace` (with `inferenceResultId: <id>` -- the verb took the new name, the body field kept the old one) or `create-single-turn` (see `--help` for the body shape) -- the response shape and follow-up polling are identical.

In all three groups, individual evaluations start at `status: PENDING` and reach `SUCCESS` / `FAILED` / `SKIPPED` / `PENDING_HUMAN` (or, rarely, `CANCELLED` / `OUTDATED`) as workers process them. Prefer `galtea evaluations list --ids …` (or `--version-ids` / `--session-ids` if the scope already filters them) over a per-id loop with `evaluations get`; the batch call traffics one HTTP request per poll cycle regardless of how many evaluations you queued. Treat `PENDING_HUMAN` as terminal for polling -- it waits for a human reviewer.

## Upload a dataset the user already has

When the user already has the test content, upload it instead of generating it. Route by what
they hold:

| The user has | Path |
|---|---|
| A CSV of rows | `galtea.datasets.create(dataset_file_path="./rows.csv")` -- rows are parsed server-side |
| Documents, images, or text and data files to attach to rows | Upload the bytes, then reference the storage URI in the row's `input` |
| Both | Add an `input_file_paths` column to the CSV; the SDK uploads each file first |
| A document dataset and an HTTP endpoint | Put `{{ input_files[0].url }}` (or `.base64`) in the endpoint connection template, then run the dataset as usual |
| A document dataset and a Python agent | `evaluations.run(agent=...)` with an `AgentInput`-annotated callback; the files arrive as `input_data.input_files` |
| A stored `uri` and wants the file | `galtea.storage.download(input_file)` saves it under its uploaded name (a bare `uri` string saves under the random storage key), `galtea.storage.read(input_file)` returns the bytes; from a terminal, `galtea storage generate-get-url --uri <uri>` then fetch the `downloadPresignedUrl` |

**Use the Python SDK for any upload or download.** It is the one place this skill prefers the
SDK over the CLI: the CLI mints the URLs and creates the dataset, but it cannot move file bytes --
`field: @/path` inlines the file into the JSON body (text as a string, a PDF as base64) instead
of uploading it. For a terminal-only
flow, `galtea storage generate-put-url` then `curl -X PUT`, and `generate-get-url` then `curl` to
read a file back.

Four things that change what you tell the user, before any command:

- **A dataset created from a file skips generation**, so it draws no generation credits and
  ignores `max_test_cases`. It is not unconditionally free: a `credits_used` column in the CSV is
  charged on import, see the gotcha below. There is no empty-dataset mode: creating a dataset *without* a file always
  runs a generator and spends credits. And `test-cases create` is one request per row, with no
  batch endpoint.
- **Galtea delivers the file to the product, but never to the judge.** A platform run sends each
  attachment to the endpoint through the `input_files` template variables, and an SDK callback
  annotated `AgentInput` receives it as `input_data.input_files`. The judge is sent the turns
  with every file stripped, so a metric reading `input` is **skipped** unless some turn carries
  file-free text; a single-turn document run always skips it. `conversation_turns` metrics are
  never skipped. Say this before the user builds a document dataset, and route them to scoring
  their pipeline's output, or to logging the extracted text as the turn input in a manual loop.
- **File types are a fixed list**, checked by the SDK before it uploads and again by the API when the test case is written: documents (`pdf`, `docx`, `xlsx`,
  `pptx`, `rtf`), images (`png`, `jpg`, `jpeg`, `tiff`, `tif`, `bmp`, `webp`, `heic`, `heif`,
  `gif`) and text or data (`txt`, `csv`, `md`, `html`, `xml`, `json`, `eml`). **Audio is not on
  it** -- a voice clip is its own part type, not a file. State the list before the user picks a
  file. A test case also caps at 20 files and 20 MB *in total*, not per file, and runs as a
  single turn only.
- **The whole file surface is on Galtea Cloud since release 5.3.0 (2026-09-14) and needs
  `galtea>=5.3.0`.** Check `pip show galtea` first: 5.2.0 uploads and downloads but its agent
  callback never sees a file. A self-hosted deployment can lag;
  [references/custom-dataset-upload.md](references/custom-dataset-upload.md) opens its attachment
  section with the version gate: `galtea build-info` when the key may read it, else a
  `generate-put-url --file-type file` probe that only separates pre-5.2 from 5.2+.

limits, the upload envelope, the three runners that deliver a file, and the terminal path -- in

## Common Workflows

Each workflow below maps to a docs page. Fetch the page via `llms.txt` before advising -- the skill provides routing, not the full procedure.

| User wants to... | Workflow | Docs path |
|---|---|---|
| Get started from zero | Quickstart: create product, install SDK, create dataset, choose metric, run evaluation | `/quickstart` |
| Define what their product should do | Write specifications, then auto-generate datasets and metrics from them | `/sdk/tutorials/writing-specifications` |
| Run dataset-based evaluations | Create datasets + metrics, run agent against test cases, evaluate | `/sdk/tutorials/run-dataset-based-evaluations` |
| Use specifications to drive everything | Spec-driven flow: specs generate metrics + datasets, then evaluate | `/sdk/tutorials/specification-driven-evaluations` |
| Test multi-turn conversations | Simulate user conversations against the agent, then evaluate sessions | `/sdk/tutorials/simulating-conversations` |
| Evaluate past conversations | Evaluate already-completed multi-turn sessions | `/sdk/tutorials/evaluating-conversations` |
| Monitor production responses | Log real user queries as traces, evaluate asynchronously | `/sdk/tutorials/monitor-production-responses-to-user-queries` |
| Set up human evaluation | Create UserGroups, link a Human Evaluation metric, group members score pending evaluations in the dashboard | `/sdk/tutorials/human-evaluation` |
| Trace agent internals | Capture internal tool calls / LLM calls as Span records | `/sdk/tutorials/tracing-agent-operations` |
| Integrate with CI/CD | Run evaluations in GitHub Actions | `/sdk/integrations/github-actions` |
| Upload a CSV of existing test cases | Create the dataset from a local CSV; rows are parsed server-side and draw no generation credits | [references/custom-dataset-upload.md](references/custom-dataset-upload.md) |
| Test an AI that reads documents | Attach each file to a test case input, let Galtea deliver it to the endpoint or the `AgentInput` callback, score the output | `/sdk/tutorials/evaluate-document-inputs`, then [references/custom-dataset-upload.md](references/custom-dataset-upload.md) for the rules |
| Send an attached file to an HTTP endpoint | Name `{{ input_files[0].url }}` / `.base64` / `.filename` / `.mime_type` in the endpoint connection template | `/concepts/product/endpoint-connection-template-syntax#attached-files-and-audio` |
| Version a test case or a judge | Edit a test case to fork a revision, or create a metric with `parentMetricId`; then replay | Local file, not a docs page: [references/entity-revisions.md](references/entity-revisions.md) |

For other workflows (custom datasets, judge prompts, agentic evaluation, custom metrics, platform-only inferences, Langfuse integration, model tracking), grep `llms.txt` for the relevant tutorial.

## CLI vs Python SDK

This skill drives the `galtea` CLI by default -- it covers everything the REST API does. For workflows that involve actually *running* the user's AI product (the agent-function loop, conversation simulation, tracing internal LLM/tool calls, inline production logging), the [Python SDK](https://docs.galtea.ai/sdk/installation) (`pip install galtea`) is usually the better fit. For the decision framework and SDK routing hints, see [references/cli-vs-sdk.md](references/cli-vs-sdk.md). Mixing the CLI and SDK in one project is safe -- they target the same backend.

When wiring an agent function for `galtea.evaluations.run(...)` or the simulator, **annotate the first parameter** -- the SDK picks the argument shape from it (`str` → latest user message, `galtea.AgentInput` → structured input, anything else **including no annotation** → a `list[dict]` chat history). The recommended approach is to use the signature `def my_agent(messages: list[dict]) -> str` or the `galtea.Agent` / `galtea.AgentInput` adapter; an unannotated first parameter receives a `list[dict]` (the SDK warns once per agent and appends a hint to the failed trace), which crashes string-assuming agents. The match is by identity, so a stringified annotation (`from __future__ import annotations`), `Optional[AgentInput]`, or a subclass also falls through to `list[dict]`. **Only the `AgentInput` / `Agent` shape receives attached files** (`input_data.input_files`); a `str` or `list[dict]` agent gets a one-time warning when a test case also has text, and a `FileOnlyTextAgentException` that fails the trace when it has files only. See [references/cli-vs-sdk.md](references/cli-vs-sdk.md) for the full mapping.

## Gotchas

Runtime behaviors that are not in `--help` text -- these are the only items a well-informed agent still needs explicit reminders for.

- **Body-taking commands hang on stdin in non-TTY contexts.** Every POST / PUT / PATCH command (`evaluations create-from-*`, `evaluations retry`, `evaluations replay-from-metrics`, `products create`, `versions update`, …) reads stdin when it's open, even when you provide all required fields via the inline shorthand form. In an interactive terminal this is fine. In scripts, CI jobs, agent harnesses, or piped invocations the command blocks forever -- the parse already succeeded, but the process never returns. Always either redirect stdin (`galtea X create field: value </dev/null`) or pipe a JSON body in (`echo '{...}' | galtea X create`). Symptom: command produces no output and the harness eventually times out.
- **`--sort` takes `field,direction` pairs -- do not use a leading `-` for descending.** On list endpoints, pass sort values like `--sort createdAt,desc`. Do **not** write `--sort -createdAt` -- the CLI parses `-createdAt` as a bundle of short flags, and `-t`/`--timeout` can end up consuming `edAt` as a duration argument, causing the command to fail before the request is sent.
- **`--ids` + any other filter yields false 404s.** Across every `list` endpoint that accepts `--ids` (evaluations, sessions, versions, products, metrics, …), the server compares `entitiesReturned.length` to the requested id count *after* all filtering has run and throws `404 "<Entity>s not found: <id-list>"` (or `"<Entity> <id> not found"` when exactly one id is missing; `<Entity>` is the display name, so `Trace` for `/inferenceResults` and `Span` for `/traces`) when they differ. So combining `--ids id1,id2,id3` with **anything else** -- `--statuses PENDING`, `--from-created-at`, `--include-legacy=false`, even another id-list filter like `--metric-ids` -- yields a 404 listing every id whose row was excluded by the *other* filter, even though the ids exist. This is especially mean in poll loops: once your evaluations leave `PENDING`, `list --ids "$IDS" --statuses PENDING` flips from `[]` to a 404 error object, and `jq 'length'` on that object returns `1` (one key: `message`), trapping a naive `while … -gt 0` forever. **Relation-id filters (`--version-ids`, `--session-ids`, `--inference-result-ids`, `--product-ids`, `--metric-ids`, `--test-ids`, …) are NOT subject to this check** and combine freely with each other and with `--statuses` / date ranges. Note the flag names come from the wire fields, so `--test-ids` filters by dataset and `--inference-result-ids` filters by trace. Two safe patterns: **(a)** if you have a relation scope (versionId, sessionId, inferenceResultId, productId), filter by `--<scope>-ids` instead of `--ids` -- those combine cleanly with `--statuses`; **(b)** if you only have raw primary-key ids, use `--ids` alone (no other filter) and filter status client-side via `jq '[.[] | select(.status == "...")] | length'`.
- **`--ids` with many IDs is rejected before the application answers.** `--ids` values go into the query string as one repeated `ids=<id>` parameter per id, so a long list is refused by the proxy in front of the API with a raw HTML page, not JSON, and piping through `jq` then crashes too. Which page depends on the environment: on dev, nginx answers `414 Request-URI Too Large` at roughly 500 to 600 ids (~15 KB); production sits behind a WAF that has answered `403 Forbidden` at as few as ~50 evaluation-length IDs (~2.3 KB). Prefer relation-id filters (`--version-ids`, `--product-ids`, `--session-ids`, …) which send a single parent id regardless of how many child rows exist. When you only have raw primary-key ids, **batch requests to ≤ 50 ids each**.
- **Boolean filters are bare flags, not `--flag true`.** CLI booleans like `--has-inference-results`, `--existent-in-evaluations`, `--can-retry` take no value: presence sends `true`; absence omits the parameter, so the server default decides (`true` for `includeLegacy`, which is why that one needs the `=false` form). `galtea versions list --has-inference-results true` errors with `accepts 0 arg(s), received 1`. In `--help`, the `FLAGS` block shows no type after the name (`--has-inference-results` rather than `--has-inference-results bool`) while the `Option Schema` block above it says `(boolean)` -- that is the cue.
- **`specifications create` takes `type: CAPABILITY | INABILITY | POLICY`, never a dataset type.** The dataset kind goes in `testType` (`QUALITY` / `RED_TEAMING` / `SCENARIOS`, wire names) and is required for `POLICY` only; `name`, `description` and `productId` are required for every type. Writing `type: QUALITY` is a `400`.
- **Attaching an existing dataset or metric to a specification is done from the specification side -- do not conclude it's impossible from `datasets update` / `metrics update`.** `specificationId` is settable only at `datasets create`; after that, `datasets update` mutates only `name` and `metadata`, and the `specifications update` payload has no dataset field either (it does carry `metricIds`, but the link verbs below are the supported path). That is a deliberate dead end, not a missing capability: the link is managed via dedicated verbs -- `galtea specifications link-datasets | unlink-datasets | link-metrics | unlink-metrics` (POST/DELETE `/specifications/{id}/tests` and `/specifications/{id}/metrics`, and the link body field is `testIds`), with `galtea specifications list-datasets` / `galtea specifications list-metrics` to inspect what is currently linked. Note the create/get responses do not echo linked datasets/metrics back -- verify a link took effect via `galtea specifications list-datasets` / `galtea specifications list-metrics`, not by re-reading the specification.
- **Datasets must be `status: SUCCESS`** before a version-wide run (`create-from-version`) picks them up. Every other status (`PENDING`, `AUGMENTING`, `EXTENDING`, `FAILED`, `CANCELLED`) is dropped: silently while one `SUCCESS` dataset remains, and as a `400` `No tests linked to specifications found` when none does. A run that names a dataset or test case id directly (`traces generate`) performs no status check; a `PENDING` dataset simply has no test cases yet. Workflow constraint, not a schema rule.
- **Duplicate names return `400 Bad Request`** (not 409) -- the underlying unique-constraint violation is caught server-side and re-thrown as a bad-request error across every create endpoint (products, versions, datasets, metrics, endpoint connections, user groups, models, sessions, specifications, evaluations). The body `message` consistently contains the substring `"with the same"` followed by the colliding fields, but the surrounding wording varies per entity. Examples: `"A Product with the same Name already exists."`, `"A Test with the same Name and Type already exists."`, `"An EndpointConnection with the same name already exists for this product."`, `"A Specification with the same description and type already exists for this product."`, `"An Evaluation with the same Version and Test already exists."`, `"A Session with the same customId: '...' already exists for version with ID: '...'."`. Those two messages really do still say `Test` -- the server text was not renamed, so match it as quoted. Match on `"with the same"` (case-insensitive) to distinguish unique-constraint violations from other 400s; do not blind-retry.
- **Span rows may have `null` `inputData` / `outputData` / `metadata`** even on valid rows (note the exact field names -- it is `inputData`, not `input`; there is no `attributes` field). Null-guard before reading. Spans are `galtea spans` on the CLI and live at `/traces` on the wire.
- **Credits are consumed** by evaluations, dataset generation, and a `credits_used` column in an uploaded dataset CSV -- reads and auth are free. For a pre-flight check, call `galtea auth get-current-user` to resolve `organizationId`, then `galtea organizations get-credit-status <organizationId>`, which returns `remainingCredits`, `monthlyCredits`, `isLowCredits` and `isExhausted`. Its OpenAPI block (and so `--help`) still declares `totalCredits` / `usedCredits`; those fields do not exist. When an org runs out, operations fail with a `400` and the credit text in `message`, and evaluations that hit the limit mid-run land as `SKIPPED` with `canRetry` true; there is no dedicated HTTP status for it, so inspect the message rather than matching on a code.
- **Error response shape is nearly stable; coverage in OpenAPI is not.** Every body the shared error handler sends is `{message: string}`, and no branch of it ever adds `error`, though the OpenAPI `Error` schema declares `{error, message}`. Seven public operations reject a bad request before reaching that handler, and those send `{error: string}` with no `message` at all: `galtea analytics get | export | get-insights | compare-insights`, `galtea jobs get | cancel`, and `galtea test-cases augment`. The auth middleware sends both fields. Other routes answer in that shape too, but every one of them carries `x-internal: true`, which strips it from the published spec, so no CLI or SDK call can reach it -- do not add them to this list. `401` is declared on ~every operation, `404` and `400` are declared on many, but `500` and runtime-only codes (credit exhaustion, upstream failures, race conditions) are frequently undeclared. On any non-2xx, read `message` from the body before deciding what to do, and fall back to `error` when `message` is absent -- do not rely on the HTTP code alone, and do not assume the spec enumerates everything the server can return.
- **A bad row in an uploaded dataset CSV deletes the dataset, and a missing column returns a bare `500`.** Validation is all-or-nothing: the first bad row stops the whole import, the insert is one transaction, and the dataset row itself is then deleted, so the user is never left with a partial dataset. Which status comes back depends on what is wrong. A **missing required column** is raised as a plain error and lands in the server-error branch, and since 5.3.0 that body says only `Something went wrong`: the row text (`Row 3 is missing required fields: input`) lives in the API log, and its row number counts parsed non-empty rows and excludes the header, so it may not match the file's line number. Every other server fault on that route answers with the same body, so check the CSV header first on a `500`; when the header is complete, it is a real platform error and worth reporting. An **invalid value** in a row, such as an unrecognised `gender` or `language`, is a normal, correctly coded `400`, and its `message` names the offending value (`gender must be one of MALE, FEMALE, got "m"`), never the row -- the check runs in a loop that carries no index. A header-only CSV does not error; it creates an empty dataset.
- **Neither presigned-URL response contains `url`.** `galtea storage generate-put-url` returns `{downloadPresignedUrl, uploadPresignedUrl}` and `galtea storage generate-get-url --uri <storedUri>` returns `{downloadPresignedUrl}`, but both operations' OpenAPI descriptions document `{url}`. The spec is wrong here, so an agent that trusts `--help` reads a field that does not exist. Its `key` argument is the **file name**, not a storage path -- the key is minted server-side under the organization's own folder, and a URI outside that folder is refused at write time. Both URLs expire in 24 hours, and an upload URL is a write capability for that object: never echo one into a log, a reply, or a bug report.
- **`credits_used` in a dataset CSV is charged to the organization.** It is an accepted column, so a value copied out of an export spends real credits on import. Drop the column unless the user means it. In the same file, `tag` sets the test case's variant while a column named `variant` is silently ignored.
- **A template with no `input_files` variable runs a text-plus-file test case without the file, and only warns.** Only a file-only test case is refused outright, with a `400` before the run starts (`Test case <id> attaches files and nothing else, but the endpoint connection template names no {{ input_files }} variable...`). A test case that also carries text runs on the text alone and the `202` carries a `warnings` list; the dashboard shows it, a script must read it, or the run scores an endpoint that never saw the document. `{{ input.content[0].uri }}` renders nothing, so the four `input_files` properties (`url`, `base64`, `filename`, `mime_type`) are the only way a file reaches an endpoint. The `url` lives 15 minutes and is re-minted per attempt; the `generate-get-url` link lives 24 hours. A run that attaches files against a template naming `input_files` skips the pre-run health check, so a broken endpoint appears as failed turns, and the dashboard's Test connection sends a placeholder attachment (a `storage.example.com` URL) whose download is expected to fail.
- **`input` metrics skip on a document run unless a turn carries file-free text.** The judge is sent the session turns with every file part stripped, never the test case input. Text beside the file does not count, so a single-turn file run (the only shape a file test case can take) always skips metrics that declare `input`, with the reason `Evaluators cannot read input files yet.`; `conversation_turns` metrics are never skipped. `evaluations.run()` and a platform run write the envelope as the turn input and cannot override it; only a manual `traces.create_and_evaluate(input=<extracted text>, ...)` scores the document's text. The Run Evaluation dialog greys out what the run would skip and names the reason. The reason sits in the evaluation's `error` field, which the SDK model does not carry (`reason` stays `None`), so read it with `galtea evaluations get <id>`.
- **`--include-legacy` is on by default, so lists mix revisions together.** Both `galtea test-cases list` and `galtea metrics list` return superseded revisions unless you turn the flag off, so a bare list shows rows the user thinks they replaced and any count overstates what is actually live. Pass it off whenever you report a count or show current state. To turn a boolean flag off use the `=` form -- `--include-legacy=false`; with `--include-legacy false` the word `false` becomes a positional argument and the list command fails with `accepts 0 arg(s), received 1`. The metric parameter is documented as "include legacy/deprecated metrics" and names no default, so do not tell a user Galtea deprecated their metric when their own revision superseded it.
- **`galtea test-cases update` forks a new revision instead of updating.** Any change to evaluation content (`input`, `expectedOutput`, `context`, `expectedTools`, `scenario`, `userPersona`, `goal`, `stoppingCriterias`, `maxIterations`, `languageCode`, `gender`) retires the old row and returns a **new id**, so anything holding the old id now points at a superseded row -- compare the returned id to the one you sent to detect it. The new revision also **resets the human annotations** (`userScore`, `userScoreReason`, `reviewedById`), so warn the user before editing a reviewed test case. Annotation-only edits, `variant`, and no-op echoes update in place and fork nothing.
- **`galtea metrics update` cannot change a judge.** It accepts only `name`, `description`, `tags`, and `userGroupIds`; anything else is refused. The refusal message names just the first three, so it reads as if assigning user groups were blocked too. A judge prompt, evaluator model, or output schema changes only by creating a revision (`galtea metrics create parentMetricId: <id>`), which flips the parent to legacy.
- **`galtea sync` is needed after API releases.** An unknown noun answers `unknown command "<x>" for "galtea"`; an unknown verb under a real noun just prints that noun's help with the verb missing from the list. If the docs say the command exists, the local spec cache is stale -- run `galtea sync` and retry.

## Skill Feedback

When the user expresses that something about this skill is not working as expected, gives incorrect guidance, is missing information, or could be improved -- offer to submit feedback to the skill maintainers. This includes when:

- The skill gave wrong or outdated instructions
- A workflow did not produce the expected result
- The user wishes the skill covered something it does not
- The user explicitly says something like "this should work differently" or "this is wrong"

**Do NOT trigger this** for issues with the Galtea product itself -- only for issues with this skill's instructions and behavior. For product issues, direct the user to `support@galtea.ai`.

When triggered, follow the process in [references/skill-feedback.md](references/skill-feedback.md).

## When not to use this skill

- **Building the AI product itself.** This skill is for *evaluating* products, not authoring them.
- **Pure UI browsing.** If the user just wants to look at results visually, point them at `https://platform.galtea.ai` instead of replaying the CLI chain.
- **Hand-writing test content.** Galtea generates test cases from specifications (see `/sdk/tutorials/writing-specifications`). Let the platform do that work.
