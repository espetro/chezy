# Entity revisions and versioning

Galtea keeps history on three entities: `Version`, `TestCase`, and `Metric`. Each one works
differently, and the word "revision" means something weaker on `Version` than on the other two.
Read the table below before you tell a user what the platform can do -- the wrong answer here is
common, because the three mechanisms do not share a vocabulary.

## What has history, and what does not

| Entity | How a new one is made | Does the old one retire? | Family key |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Version` | Create a **new** version with `parentVersionId` | **No.** Both stay active and runnable | none |
| `TestCase` | **Edit it.** A content edit forks automatically | Yes, the old row is marked legacy | `testCaseGroupId` |
| `Metric` | Create a **new** metric with `parentMetricId` | Yes, the parent is flipped to legacy | `metricGroupId` |

**`Dataset` itself has no revisions.** This is the most common wrong answer. A `Dataset` (the
`/tests` wire path) carries no lineage and no legacy marker. Its `sourceTestId` records that it
was copied or extended from another dataset, which is provenance, not versioning. Only the
individual `TestCase` rows inside it carry revisions. So when a user asks for "dataset
versioning", the honest answer is: you version each test case, and the dataset is the container
those revisions live in. Do not claim a dataset can be rolled back to an earlier state.

Nothing else on the platform has revisions. `Product`, `Specification`, `Session`, `Trace`,
`Span`, and `Evaluation` have none.

## There is no revision number

No entity carries a revision counter. Nothing answers "which revision is this" or "how many
exist in this family". You cannot render `revision 3 of 5`, because neither number exists. Order
within a family can only be inferred from `createdAt` plus walking the parent links one hop at a
time. Never invent a revision number in output you show a user.

## Reading history: expect one hop, not a tree

**No endpoint returns an entity's revision history.** There is no `GET /<entity>/:id/revisions`
and no ancestor query. Metrics have a family filter, test cases do not: `GET /metrics` accepts
`metricGroupIds` and returns every revision of a family in one call, while `GET /testCases`
accepts no `testCaseGroupIds`, so that key is a label you can read off a row but not search by.

```bash
# Every revision of one metric family, legacy ones included.
galtea metrics list --metric-group-ids <metricGroupId>
```

To reconstruct a test case family you must list broadly and group client-side:

```bash
# Every revision of every test case in one dataset, then group by testCaseGroupId yourself.
# Superseded rows come back by default, so no flag is needed to see them.
galtea test-cases list --test-ids <datasetId>
```

`Version` is the one exception, and only downward by one hop:

```bash
# The versions created directly from this one. Children only, one level.
galtea versions list --parent-version-ids <versionId>
```

## `--include-legacy` includes superseded rows by default

Both list endpoints **include** superseded revisions unless you say otherwise:

| Command | Default | So a bare list gives you |
|---|---|---|
| `galtea test-cases list` | include | every revision, superseded ones mixed in |
| `galtea metrics list` | include | every revision, superseded ones mixed in |

So a bare `galtea test-cases list` returns rows the user thinks they replaced, and counting them
overstates the dataset size. The same is true of a metric list. Whenever you report a count or
show the user "what is in here now", pass the flag off.

**To turn a boolean flag off you must use the `=` form.** Write `--include-legacy=false`, never
`--include-legacy false` -- these are bare flags, so the space form makes `false` a positional
argument, and a list command takes none: it fails with `accepts 0 arg(s), received 1`.

**Do not combine `--include-legacy=false` with `--ids`.** The server compares the rows it
returns against the ids you asked for, so an id the flag legitimately excluded comes back as
`Metric <id> not found` -- a 404 for a row that exists and is merely superseded. Filter by a
relation instead (`--names`, `--product-ids`, `--test-ids`) whenever you turn the flag off.

**More than one body field needs commas between them.** Write
`galtea metrics create name: "x", parentMetricId: <id>`. Without the commas the shorthand parser
swallows every later field into the first field's string value and the write fails naming the
wrong field (`"name" is required`), so the mistake does not look like a syntax error. A
single-field body is safe either way. A value that itself contains a comma, such as a judge
prompt, cannot go through the shorthand at all: pipe the body as JSON on stdin. An array can, in
the bracket form the `--help` examples use (`evaluationParams: [input, actual_output]`); a
repeated `field:` does not make an array.

The test-case parameter is documented as "include superseded revisions", but the metric one is
documented as "include legacy/deprecated metrics" and states no default. That wording invites two
mistakes: assuming metrics behave the opposite way, and telling a user Galtea deprecated their
metric when in fact their own revision superseded it.

## Per entity

### Version -- provenance only

A version is never forked and never retired. `PATCH /versions/:id` edits in place, so an edit
loses the previous state with no history kept. Lineage is a label saying where this version came
from.

```bash
# A "revision" is just a new version that names its parent.
galtea versions create productId: <id>, name: "v2", parentVersionId: <parentId> </dev/null
```

The parent stays fully active: it still runs, still evaluates, and still appears in a bare list.
The parent must belong to the same product or the write is refused.

Python SDK: `versions.create(..., parent_version_id=...)`, `versions.list(parent_version_id=...)`,
and `parent_version_id` on the returned model. This is the best-covered of the three in the SDK.

### TestCase -- forks on edit, silently

**A content edit does not update a test case. It creates a new revision and retires the old
row.** Tell the user this before they edit, because nothing in the command output says it
happened.

A fork is triggered only by a change to evaluation content: `input`, `expectedOutput`, `context`,
`expectedTools`, `scenario`, `userPersona`, `goal`, `stoppingCriterias`, `maxIterations`,
`languageCode`, or `gender`. Everything else edits in place, including the annotation fields
(`userScore`, `userScoreReason`, `reviewedById`) and `variant`. Re-sending an unchanged value is a no-op and
forks nothing.

```bash
# This forks. The old row stays, marked legacy, and this returns a NEW id.
galtea test-cases update <testCaseId> input: "the corrected question" </dev/null
```

Two consequences worth stating to a user:

- **The returned id is new.** Anything holding the old id now points at a superseded row. Compare
  the id in the response to the one you sent to detect that a fork happened.
- **Human annotations do not carry over.** The new revision resets `userScore`,
  `userScoreReason`, and `reviewedById`, because those scores were given to the old content. A
  user who has spent review effort on a test case loses it on a content edit. Say so first. The
  revision also resets `creditsUsed` and clears `seedSessionId`.

A family always has exactly one active revision. Only a row that is neither legacy nor deleted
can be edited; editing a superseded revision is refused.

Python SDK: **`test_cases` has no `update()`**, so an SDK-only user cannot create a test-case
revision at all. Route them to the CLI or the dashboard. The SDK can read the lineage fields
(`legacy_at`, `test_case_group_id`, `parent_test_case_id`) and filter with
`test_cases.list(include_legacy=...)`.

### Metric -- a revision is created, not edited

`PATCH /metrics/:id` **never** forks, and it accepts only `name`, `description`, `tags`, and
`userGroupIds`. The refusal message names just the first three, so it reads as if assigning user
groups were blocked too.
Anything else is refused. So a judge prompt, an evaluator model, or a scoring schema cannot be
edited at all -- changing one means creating a revision.

```bash
# Creating with a parent joins its family and flips the parent to legacy.
galtea metrics create name: "answer-relevancy-v2", parentMetricId: <parentId> </dev/null
```

Optimization is the same mechanism run by the platform: `galtea metrics optimize <id>` creates a
revision in the source's family and only retires the source once the run succeeds, so a failed
optimization leaves the original usable.

Python SDK: the weakest coverage of the three, and worth warning a user about.
**`metrics.create()` takes no `parent_metric_id`**, so the SDK cannot create a metric revision.
The returned model also has **no** `parent_metric_id` field, and unknown fields are ignored
rather than surfaced, so the parent link the API sends is dropped without an error. An SDK user
therefore cannot read a metric's parent either. Use the CLI for anything involving metric
lineage.

## Re-running after a revision

A new revision does not re-score anything by itself. Existing evaluations still belong to the
revision they ran against. Two commands replay onto the new revision:

```bash
galtea test-cases get-replay-candidate-count <testCaseId>
galtea metrics get-replay-candidate-count <metricId>
```

Then `galtea evaluations replay-from-test-cases` or `galtea evaluations replay-from-metrics`.
Both return `202` and cost credits, so surface the candidate count to the user and get their
agreement before replaying.

## Answering "can I version X?"

- **A product version:** yes, as provenance. The old version keeps working.
- **A test case:** yes, and it happens automatically when the content changes.
- **A judge or metric:** yes, by creating a revision. Not by editing it.
- **A whole dataset:** no. Version the test cases inside it.
- **Anything else:** no.

For the current argument shapes always run `galtea <noun> <verb> --help`, and read
`https://docs.galtea.ai/concepts/product/dataset/test-case.md` for the test-case revision rules
as the platform documents them.
