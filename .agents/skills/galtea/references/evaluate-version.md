description: End-to-end CLI walkthrough for running evaluations against a Galtea product version via `galtea evaluations create-from-version`. Use when the user asks to run a full evaluation pass on a version, kick off evaluations, or needs to understand the async evaluation lifecycle concretely.

# Worked example -- evaluate a product version

End-to-end flow for `galtea evaluations create-from-version` -- the one-shot path that cascades across the product's specifications, their linked metrics, and their linked datasets. Use this when the user wants to "run the full eval pass" for a version.

## Before you start

`galtea --version` should return a version, and `galtea whoami` should report `authenticated`. If either fails, fix it first via the CLI Installation and Authentication sections in `SKILL.md`.

## 5-step flow

```bash
# 1. Find the product
galtea products list -o json | jq '.[] | {id, name}'

# 2. Find the version to evaluate
galtea versions list --product-ids <productId> -o json | jq '.[] | {id, name}'

# 3. Kick off evaluations for the whole version. Galtea resolves the product's
#    specifications, their linked metrics, and their linked datasets automatically.
#    Returns 202 with a jobId -- the actual evaluations are created asynchronously.
#    </dev/null on the inline-shorthand form is required in non-TTY contexts
#    (scripts, CI, agent harnesses); without it the command blocks on stdin
#    even though the inline body is complete. See SKILL.md Gotchas.
galtea evaluations create-from-version versionId: <versionId> </dev/null

# 4. List the freshly-created evaluations to grab their IDs (the create call only returned a job id).
#    --sort takes `field,direction` pairs. Don't use a leading `-` for descending
#    (e.g. `--sort -createdAt`) -- the CLI parses `-createdAt` as a short-flag combination,
#    and `-t` (`--timeout`) can consume `edAt` as a duration value, causing the command
#    to fail before the request is sent.
galtea evaluations list \
  --version-ids <versionId> \
  --statuses PENDING \
  --sort createdAt,desc \
  --limit 20 \
  -o json | jq '.[] | {id, metricId, status}'

# 5. Batch-poll the whole set with the same list call (without the --statuses filter
#    you can re-use it as a snapshot; with --statuses PENDING it tells you whether
#    any are still pending). One HTTP request per poll cycle, regardless of count.
while [ "$(galtea evaluations list --version-ids <versionId> --statuses PENDING -o json | jq 'length')" -gt 0 ]; do
  sleep 5
done

# Final snapshot: every evaluation for this version with its terminal status.
# (PENDING_HUMAN entries stay listed -- they're terminal for polling, awaiting a human reviewer.)
# `reason` is the judge's scoring note; `error` is why a FAILED or SKIPPED one ended there,
# credit exhaustion included, and `canRetry` says whether `evaluations retry` will take it.
galtea evaluations list --version-ids <versionId> -o json \
  | jq '.[] | {id, metricId, status, score, reason, error, canRetry}'
```

The body takes `versionId` **or** `productId`, plus optional `specificationIds`. With `productId` alone the platform clones the product's latest properly configured version and runs against the clone, which needs permission to create versions (a `403` otherwise); the `202` names the clone in `versionId`. For these body fields the CLI uses Restish's inline shorthand: `key: value` pairs, comma-separated, with arrays in `[a, b, c]` form. To pass multiple specifications:

```bash
galtea evaluations create-from-version versionId: <versionId>, specificationIds: [<spec1>, <spec2>] </dev/null
```

If you prefer JSON-on-stdin (cleaner for complex bodies, and naturally avoids the stdin-hang gotcha):

```bash
echo '{"versionId":"<versionId>","specificationIds":["<spec1>","<spec2>"]}' \
  | galtea evaluations create-from-version
```

Run `galtea evaluations create-from-version --help` for the canonical request schema and the `EXAMPLES` block.

## Why step 4 is needed

`create-from-version` returns `202 Accepted` with a `jobId` because the evaluation jobs are created asynchronously -- one per test case per metric of that test case's own specification (a dataset belongs to one specification, so its rows are never crossed with another specification's metrics). The caller has to list the freshly-created evaluations (status `PENDING`, filtered by `versionId`) to learn their IDs, then poll each one until `status` reaches a terminal state.

Terminal states for the poll:

- `SUCCESS`, `FAILED`, `SKIPPED`, `CANCELLED`, `OUTDATED` -- stop polling and report to the user.
- `PENDING_HUMAN` -- evaluation is waiting for a human reviewer. Stop polling and surface that state to the user; this evaluation will never reach SUCCESS on its own.

## Common pitfalls

- **Datasets must be `status: SUCCESS`** before `create-from-version` will create evaluations against them. Every other status (`PENDING`, `AUGMENTING`, `EXTENDING`, `FAILED`, `CANCELLED`) is dropped, silently while at least one `SUCCESS` dataset remains; when none does, the call answers `400` `No tests linked to specifications found`. Check `galtea datasets list --product-ids <productId>` first if step 4 returns fewer evaluations than expected.
- **Credits are consumed** by the newly-created evaluations. Pre-flight by resolving the org id (`galtea auth get-current-user -f body.organizationId`), then `galtea organizations get-credit-status <organizationId>` (run `--help` for the exact arg shape) to inspect `remainingCredits`, `monthlyCredits`, `isLowCredits` and `isExhausted` (the `--help` response schema still says `totalCredits` / `usedCredits`; those fields do not exist). A call that cannot afford its evaluations answers `400` with the credit text in `message`; evaluations that hit the limit mid-run land as `SKIPPED` with that text as their reason and `canRetry` true, so top up and `galtea evaluations retry` them.
- **Duplicate names** on related resources (products, versions, datasets, metrics) return `400 Bad Request` with a body `message` containing the substring `"with the same"` (case-insensitive). Wording varies per entity -- see the duplicate-name gotcha in `SKILL.md` for examples. Do not blind-retry on any 400; parse the message first.
- **Stale local spec**. If `galtea evaluations create-from-version` errors with "unknown command" or a flag the docs say exists is missing, run `galtea sync` to refresh the OpenAPI command tree.

## Alternative creation paths

`create-from-version` is only one entry point. For `create-from-session`, `create-from-sessions`, `create-from-trace`, `create-single-turn`, `retry`, `replay-from-metrics`, and `replay-from-test-cases`, see the "Evaluation creation paths" routing table in `SKILL.md`. Each one is a sibling under `galtea evaluations`; run `galtea evaluations --help` to see the full verb list.
